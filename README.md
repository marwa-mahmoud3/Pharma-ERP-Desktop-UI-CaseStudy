# 💊 Advanced Pharmacy Desktop App UI Case Study

> **A massive UI/UX project for a Pharmacy ERP system. Following my success in the POS challenge, I was commissioned to design the full visual and structural architecture for this enterprise suite using C# and DevExpress.**

---

## 🌟 Context & Scope
This project was my second professional collaboration with the same ITI instructor. My role was to architect the **User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)** for the entire ERP system, ensuring a seamless, consistent, and professional look across all business modules.

### **Why this is a "Senior" UI Project:**
* **Complexity**: Designing interfaces for high-density data (Financials, Inventory, HR).
* **Consistency**: Managing a unified design system across multiple modules.
* **Prototyping to Implementation**: Converting complex business requirements into functional DevExpress layouts.

* **Accounting Dashboards**: Clean layouts for financial tracking and reporting.
* **Analytics Views**: Designed for data visualization and sales performance.

### 📦 Store & Inventory Management

* **Fast-Action Panels**: Grouped medical categories (e.g., Pain & Fever, Hypotension) for rapid navigation.

### 🏥 Reception & HR
* **Doctor & Patient Directories**: Organized interfaces for healthcare provider management.
* **Employee Management**: Screens for HR, roles, and system permissions.
